Analyze my cricket performance using the CSV I uploaded. Each ‘Session’ represents one ball, and the ‘Run’ column indicates how many runs were scored on that ball. The data contains time-series values of raw acceleration and smoothed acceleration from my smart cricket bat. I want you to evaluate the stability of my bat angle before the swing, the acceleration build-up during the backswing, the smoothness and peak of the downswing, the consistency of impact, and the follow-through behavior. Give me a clear paragraph summarizing the performance for each ball (Session 1 to Session X), compare the power and control between balls, and then provide a final summary of my overall technique. Also explain how I can improve my next game
